# Overview

{This project was designed to advance my skills as a software engineer by combining web development with data integration. It challenged me to work with APIs, manipulate dynamic content, and handle real-world scenarios like network errors gracefully. Through this experience, I strengthened my knowledge of JavaScript syntax and patterns, improved my ability to work with third-party libraries, and gained insights into how interactive maps can enhance web applications.}

{This project is an interactive Air Quality Index (AQI) map that visualizes real-time air quality data for multiple cities in Peru. Using the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript, the software plots markers on a map representing various districts, with each marker displaying relevant AQI levels and dominant pollutants. Users can search for locations, use geolocation to center the map, and view information through popup windows.}

{The primary goal of this software is to integrate location-based services with real-time data visualization. By developing this project, I explored essential JavaScript concepts such as asynchronous programming with the Fetch API, recursion for error handling, and UI customization. Additionally, I aimed to build an engaging user experience by incorporating map widgets, like search tools and geolocation services.}

# Future Work

- Enhance UI: Make the map more visually appealing by customizing markers and adding animations.
- Expand Features: Add filtering options to display only certain AQI levels or pollutants.
- Offline Functionality: Cache previously fetched AQI data to handle cases where users lose connectivity.
